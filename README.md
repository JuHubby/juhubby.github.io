## Description:
This is my portfolio, showcasing a collection of projects, assignments, and creative works that serve as tangible demonstrations of my skills and expertise.

## How to Run:

As explained on the webpage, you will need to have the following before creating your repository:

 - Create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
 - Download and install Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
 - Download and install Git Bash.

After obtaining the above, the remaining steps are explained on the website.

## Usage:

No specific programs or modules are required to run this repo; it functions as my portfolio and serves as both the landing page and project overview. Feel free to explore inside the repo for links to my developed repositories, each accompanied by a description. For your convenience, I've also included the links to the showcased repositories on the website.
