As explained on the webpage, you will need to have the following before creating your repository:

 - Create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
 - Download and install Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

After obtaining the above, the remaining steps are explained on the website.

## Usage:

No specific programs or modules are required to run this repo; it functions as my portfolio and serves as both the landing page and project overview.
